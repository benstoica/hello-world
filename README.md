Hello World-First Repo!

i! My name is Ben and I'm an aspiring Web Developer. I am entirely self-taught and learning through several online programs such as Free Code Camp, Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp, and Rob Percival's Web Developer course through Udemy. My ultimate goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer.
